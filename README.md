## Install

```bash
bunx grouter-auth setup
```

Or install globally:

```bash
bun install -g grouter-auth
grouter setup
```

> Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.0

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Add a connection - wizard walks you through OAuth or API key per provider
grouter add

# 2. Start the proxy daemon (router on 3099, providers on 3100+)
grouter serve on

# 3. Wire your tool to it interactively
grouter up openclaude       # arrow-key picker -> provider -> model
```

Open the dashboard at **http://localhost:3099** to manage everything visually - add/remove connections, see live token usage per account, swap rotation strategy, tail logs.

### Using it programmatically

Any OpenAI-compatible client works:

```ts
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3099/v1',
  apiKey: 'any-value',
})

const res = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-6',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
})
```

---

## Quality updates

Recent hardening updates shipped on **April 21, 2026**:

- Added unit coverage for `rotator`, `upstream`, `claude-translator`, `codex-translator`, and `gemini-translator`.
- Fixed round-robin sticky selection edge case in `src/rotator/index.ts` (selection now stays correct when sticky limit is reached).
- Added explicit field validation and safe patch typing in account update flow (`src/db/accounts.ts`) to prevent invalid patch keys.
- Added aggressive asset optimization pipeline:
  - logos are now packed with brotli in prebuild and lazily decompressed at runtime
  - `animation.js` is embedded as gzip payload and inflated only when needed
- Added `bun run assets:benchmark` to measure logo pack size, animation payload size, and final binary size.
- Added safe static asset delivery optimization for dashboard assets (`ETag`/`304` and gzip for `/public/animation.js` when supported).
- Hardened CORS defaults for dashboard/API responses: allow-origin is now opt-in via `GROUTER_CORS_ALLOW_ALL=true` or `GROUTER_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN=https://your-origin`.
- Standardized dashboard API parsing/error helpers (`src/web/api-http.ts`) to reduce handler duplication and keep response behavior consistent.
- Added API HTTP helper tests and smoke E2E coverage (`tests/api-http.test.ts`, `tests/e2e-smoke.test.ts`) for startup/health/status/CORS.
- Fixed OAuth callback-listener sweeper timer to `unref()` so short-lived test/runtime processes can exit cleanly.
- Tightened CI gate to fail on TypeScript errors and always execute `bun test`.
- Finalized CLI status output cleanup to remove encoding artifacts and keep terminal-safe output.
- Kept CI-style validation for this branch: `bun test` and `bun run build` passing.

## Providers

Every provider gets its own dedicated port so requests never get misrouted. The router on `:3099` picks any active account; the per-provider ports (`:3100`, `:3101`, ...) pin the request to that provider's pool.

### OAuth providers (bring your subscription)

| Provider | Flow | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Qwen Code** | device_code | deprecated - existing accounts still work |
| **GitHub Copilot** | device_code | uses your Copilot subscription |
| **Kimi Coding** | device_code | **FREE** |
| **KiloCode** | device_code | **FREE** |
| **Kiro** (AWS SSO) | device_code | **FREE** - AWS Builder ID |
| **Claude** | auth_code + PKCE | Claude.ai subscription |
| **Codex** (OpenAI) | auth_code + PKCE | fixed port `1455` callback |
| **GitLab Duo** | auth_code + PKCE | bring your own OAuth app |
| **iFlow** | auth_code | **FREE** - returns a long-lived API key |
| **Qoder** | auth_code | device-token OAuth |
| **Cline** | auth_code | browser redirect |
| **Cursor** | import_token | paste token from Cursor IDE |
| **OpenCode** | free / no-auth | **FREE** - public shared endpoint |

### API-key providers

OpenRouter - Groq - DeepSeek - OpenAI - Anthropic - Google Gemini - NVIDIA NIM - add multiple keys per provider; all of them can round-robin.

Providers marked **FREE** need no credit card. Free-tier API keys (OpenRouter, NVIDIA, Gemini) are flagged with a badge in the dashboard.

## Commands

### Setup & connections

```bash
grouter setup             # Interactive onboarding (add -> test -> serve -> openclaude)
grouter add               # Wizard - arrow-key pick a provider, run the right flow
grouter list              # Table: ID, email, status, priority, expiration
grouter remove <id>       # Remove by ID prefix or email
grouter enable <id>       # Re-enable a disabled connection
grouter disable <id>      # Skip a connection without deleting it
grouter test [id]         # Check upstream reachability
```

### Proxy daemon

```bash
grouter serve on          # Start in background
grouter serve off         # Stop the daemon
grouter serve             # Show status (router port + per-provider ports)
grouter serve restart     # Restart (kills stale processes holding the port)
grouter serve logs        # Tail the log
grouter serve fg          # Run in foreground (blocks terminal)
```

### Models & routing

```bash
grouter models                 # All providers, their ports, and model IDs
grouter models <provider>      # Zoom into one + copy-paste OPENAI_* examples
                             #   e.g. grouter models claude
```

### Tool integration

```bash
grouter up openclaude          # Wizard: pick provider (up/down) -> pick model -> write settings.json
grouter up openclaude --provider kiro --model claude-sonnet-4.5
grouter up openclaude --remove # Undo the integration
```

The wizard writes the env block to `~/.claude/settings.json` and injects `export` lines into `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` / `config.fish` (or a PowerShell profile on Windows).

### Monitoring

```bash
grouter status            # Token totals, estimated cost, active locks
grouter unlock [id]       # Clear rate-limit locks on one or all accounts
```

### Configuration

```bash
grouter config                            # Show current settings
grouter config --strategy round-robin     # fill-first (default) | round-robin
grouter config --port 3099                # Change router port
grouter config --sticky-limit 5           # Requests before rotating (round-robin)
```

## Per-provider ports

When you add the first connection for a provider, grouter allocates a dedicated port starting at `:3100`. This isolates provider routing cleanly:

```
$ grouter serve
  * Proxy running   ->  http://localhost:3099
  providers  kimi-coding:3100   claude:3101   kiro:3102
```

Point your tool at the specific port if you want to **pin a provider**:
```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3100/v1   # forces Kimi
OPENAI_MODEL=kimi-k2.5
```

Or use the router (`:3099`) and grouter picks from all active accounts using the configured rotation strategy.

---

## Dashboard

Visit `http://localhost:3099/dashboard` once the proxy is running.

- Add/remove connections per provider with live OAuth flows (device-code, auth-code, token-paste)
- Stack multiple API keys per provider - visual pool
- Proxy pools: route specific connections through HTTP proxies
- Token/cost tracking per account, per model
- FREE badges on free-tier providers
- Multi-language (EN / PT / ZH)

---

## How it works

- **OAuth orchestrator** - pluggable adapters (`src/auth/providers/*.ts`) implement device-code / auth-code + PKCE / auth-code / import flows; one file per provider keeps diffs small.
- **Ephemeral callback listener** - spins up a local HTTP server on a random port (or `:1455` for Codex) to catch the OAuth redirect, then shuts it down.
- **Per-provider listeners** - each provider registered in `provider_ports` gets its own `Bun.serve` instance that forces the provider on every request.
- **Auto token refresh** - each adapter owns its refresh logic; GitHub's short-lived copilot token is cached separately in `provider_data`.
- **Rotation strategies** - `fill-first` (stay on highest-priority until it rate-limits) or `round-robin` (cycle with configurable stickiness).
- **Zero external services** - everything runs locally, data lives in `~/.grouter/grouter.db` (SQLite).

## Architecture

- High-level architecture and module boundaries are documented in [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md).
- Agent-oriented implementation details and contributor guardrails are in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## Development

Want to hack on grouter? Runtime is [Bun](https://bun.sh) only.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GXDEVS/grouter.git
cd grouter
bun install

bun run dev           # hot-reload, foreground proxy (bun --hot index.ts serve fg)
bun run start         # foreground proxy, no hot-reload
bun run build         # embeds logos, bundles to dist/grouter
bun run deploy        # build + bun link (refresh the globally-linked binary)
bun run assets:benchmark  # print asset + binary size metrics
bun test              # Bun test runner
```

Alternative one-shot setup (installs deps + `bun link` in one step):

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Project layout:

```
index.ts              # CLI entry - commander wiring
src/
|-- commands/         # one file per subcommand (add, serve, list, ...)
|-- auth/
|   |-- orchestrator.ts
|   `-- providers/    # one adapter per provider (device_code / auth_code + PKCE / import)
|-- providers/
|   `-- registry.ts   # single source of truth for provider metadata
|-- proxy/            # Bun.serve listeners, upstream builder, translators
|-- rotator/          # account selection + strategies
|-- token/            # OAuth refresh
|-- db/               # SQLite schema + silent migrations
|-- web/              # dashboard + wizard (served as text imports)
`-- update/           # update banner
scripts/
|-- embed-logos.ts       # prebuild - emits src/web/logos-embedded.ts (brotli-packed)
|-- embed-animation.ts   # prebuild - emits src/public/animation-embedded.ts (gzip-packed)
`-- asset-benchmark.ts   # prints asset + binary size metrics
```

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the full architecture guide - request flow, provider-registry rules, database migration conventions, and Bun-first runtime defaults.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome. The project ships with a skill at `.claude/skills/contribute/` that walks contributors through the full flow if you use Claude Code; the summary below is the same contract.

### 1. Branch naming

```
<type>/<short-kebab-description>
```

Lowercase, kebab-case, under 60 chars. Types:

| Prefix | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat/` | new user-visible capability (new provider, CLI command, dashboard view) |
| `fix/` | bug fix |
| `hotfix/` | urgent production fix |
| `refactor/` | internal restructuring, no behavior change |
| `perf/` | performance improvement |
| `chore/` | deps, build, tooling |
| `docs/` | README, AGENTS.md, comments |
| `test/` | tests only |
| `ci/` | `.github/workflows`, release pipelines |
| `release/` | release prep (e.g. `release/v4.8.0`) |

Examples: `feat/add-zai-provider`, `fix/token-refresh-race`, `perf/sqlite-wal-mode`, `chore/bump-commander`.

### 2. Commits - Conventional Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <short imperative description>

<optional body - why, not what>

<optional footer - BREAKING CHANGE: ..., Refs: ..., Closes #123>
```

Rules:

- Subject <= 72 chars, imperative mood, lowercase after the colon, no trailing period.
- One logical change per commit - stage explicit files, never `git add -A`.
- No emojis in subject, body, or footer.
- No `Co-Authored-By: <AI assistant>` / "Generated with ..." footers.
- Scopes match the directory layout: `auth`, `auth/<provider>`, `proxy`, `proxy/upstream`, `rotator`, `token`, `db`, `providers`, `commands`, `commands/<cmd>`, `web`, `web/dashboard`, `update`, `cli`, `build`.

Commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`. Use `wip` only on private branches that will be squashed before merge.

### 3. Adding a new provider

1. Add an entry to `PROVIDERS` in `src/providers/registry.ts` (models, colors, auth type, deprecation flag).
2. Drop `src/auth/providers/<id>.ts` exporting an `OAuthAdapter` (`device_code` / `auth_code` + optional PKCE / `import_token`).
3. Register it in `src/auth/providers/index.ts`.
4. Add any provider-specific upstream quirks to `src/proxy/upstream.ts`.
5. Drop a PNG at `src/public/logos/<id>.png` - the prebuild step picks it up on the next `bun run build`.

New columns on `accounts` go in the silent-migration `ALTER TABLE` block in `src/db/index.ts`, **not** in the initial `CREATE TABLE` - existing users already have their database.

### 4. Pull request

1. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`.
2. Open PR: `gh pr create` (title mirrors the primary commit).
3. PR body:

   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   - what changed, in plain terms
   - why this approach
   - anything reviewers should look at first

   ## Test plan
   - [ ] concrete manual or automated check
   - [ ] `bun test` passes (or note why it's not relevant)
   - [ ] `bun run build` succeeds
   ```

4. Do not force-push to `main`. Do not `--no-verify` commit hooks. Do not amend a commit that was already pushed.
5. CI must be green before merge.

### Questions first

For non-trivial changes (new provider with odd OAuth flow, schema migration, rotator behavior), **open an issue first** so we can align on the approach before you invest time in the PR.
